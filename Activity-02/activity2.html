            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a second year student in Brigham Young University-Hawaii majoring in Information Technology. I love the beach and the ocean up here in North Shore. Growing up in the small island called Tuvalu, my Dad always take me and my brother's out fishing on weekends.</p>
            <p>As a student at Brigham Young University, I found myself on an unexpected adventure when I decided to spend a semester abroad in Hawaii. Hailing from the tranquil shores of a small island in the South Pacific, the bustling energy of Oahu was a stark contrast to the close-knit community I was accustomed to. Despite the cultural differences, I embraced the opportunity to immerse myself in the vibrant tapestry of Hawaiian life.</p>
            <p>Living in Hawaii offered me a unique perspective on both island living and academics. With my textbooks in hand, I often found myself studying against the backdrop of towering palm trees and the distant hum of waves crashing against the shore. The serene beauty of the island served as both a sanctuary for reflection and a catalyst for my intellectual growth.</p>
            <P>Despite the allure of Hawaii's natural wonders, my commitment to my studies at BYU remained unwavering. Whether attending virtual lectures from my beachside apartment or participating in cultural exchanges with local Hawaiian communities, I remained deeply rooted in my academic pursuits. Through this cross-cultural exchange, I discovered parallels between my island home and the vibrant spirit of aloha that permeated Hawaiian culture.</P>
            <p>As my semester in Hawaii drew to a close, I couldn't help but reflect on the transformative journey I had undertaken. From navigating the bustling streets of Honolulu to hiking through lush rainforests reminiscent of my island upbringing, every experience had deepened my appreciation for the interconnectedness of diverse cultures and landscapes. With a newfound sense of gratitude and an enriched perspective on island life, I returned to my small Pacific island home, eager to share the lessons I had learned and inspire others to embrace the beauty of both their own communities and the wider world beyond.</p>
