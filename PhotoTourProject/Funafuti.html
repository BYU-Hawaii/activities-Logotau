            Funafuti is the capital of Tuvalu and the country's largest atoll, comprising about 33 islets encircling a vast central lagoon. 
            The atoll has a total land area of approximately 2.4 square kilometers, while the lagoon covers about 275 square kilometers, making it a crucial resource for fishing and transportation.
            Funafuti is the most populated atoll in Tuvalu, with about half of the nation's population residing there. The island hosts the country's administrative and governmental centers, including the Parliament and the international airport. 
            Funafuti is characterized by its lush vegetation, coconut palms, and vibrant marine life.
            Its combination of natural beauty and infrastructural significance makes it a central hub for Tuvaluan culture, economy, and governance.
