        <h2>About the Tuvalu Food</h2>
        <p>
            Tuvaluan cuisine is a delightful blend of local traditions and Pacific influences, emphasizing fresh, local ingredients. Staples like pulaka (swamp taro) and breadfruit are often boiled, roasted, or fried. 
            Fresh fish is prepared in various ways, including grilling, baking, or raw with coconut milk. Coconut crab, a unique delicacy, is cooked in coconut milk or grilled. Traditional dishes like lukimea (boiled fish with grated coconut in taro leaves) and snacks like banana fritters add to the diversity.
            Coconut is a vital ingredient in many dishes, while pandanus fruit is enjoyed raw or in desserts. Iconic dishes include a traditional fish dish, a famous Tuvaluan coconut crab feast, and raw fish with coconut milk.
